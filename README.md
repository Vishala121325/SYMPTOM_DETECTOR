#﻿#  SYMPTOM_DETECTOR
-- AI-Based Symptom Checker 
     Project Title: 
-- AI-Powered Disease Prediction and Symptom Checker 
     Brief Description: 
This application is a web-based system that predicts potential diseases based on user-selected symptoms using a trained machine learning model. It 
is designed to help users understand their symptoms and take preventive steps accordingly. 
________________________________________ 
       Objectives: 
• Predict the most likely disease from a list of symptoms provided by the user. 
• Enable early health insights through a machine learning classification system. 
• Build a smooth, minimalistic user interface for symptom selection and disease output.

 Technologies Used: 
• Programming Language: Python 
• Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Flask 
• Frontend: HTML, CSS 
• Model Used: Decision Tree Classifier 
________________________________________ 
        Key Features: 
• Drop-down symptom selection 
• Disease prediction using Decision Tree model 
• Flask web app with real-time inference
